Star-Chaser
===========
This repository contains the files for Star Chaser, a 2D platform game made using HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, and bits of a simple game engine (very aptly) named simpleGame.js.

I made this game primarily as a way to introduce myself to game programming (and to familiarize myself with the thought process required or it). As the code gets cleaned up and features are added/updated, more changes and commits will come in the future. 

To access the current version of the game, click on this URL: http://topeo.github.io/Star-Chaser/

**NOTE**: The game is designed to be viewed on a desktop/laptop computer. For the best experience, use either Internet Explorer or Google           Chrome.
